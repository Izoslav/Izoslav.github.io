Hi, my name is Marcin Ko≈Çodziej. I may not be as experianced as other people that write blogs about programming, but I'll try to share my knowledge on different topics. I am working as a programmer since 2014, mostly using C++ in projects, but also plethora of other languages and technologies like Erlang, Python, JavaScript.

Besides programming I also gave lectures at West Pomeranian University of Technology in Szczecin, and prepared C++ trainings at companies I've worked before.

You can find my open source code on my github page:
